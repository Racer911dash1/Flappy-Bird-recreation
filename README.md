# Flappy-Bird-recreation
An attempt to recreate Flappy bird in Godot

Also thought this is a good way to try out how GitHub works
I Ctrl C + Ctrl V the assets from this Github page: https://github.com/samuelcust/flappy-bird-assets
I also downloaded this flappy bird font by "Hizrok": https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1472935/flappy-bird-font
because I am absolutely not going to try adding images in a Text Label, no thank you.
